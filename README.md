# Collaborative-ML-Fading-Channel-Model
This repo contains the code for year 3 undergraduate project titled "Machine Learning for Receiver Design", Student: Afzal Hamza, Supervisor: Dr. Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, EEE Department, University of Surrey.

The idea of this project is to have a federation of wireless users to collect a distributed dataset upon which users train their respective local neural network (NN)s and then collaborate to train a universal wireless receiver.

# Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of  real and complex values, which are processed within the code itself to separate training and testing values.

# Usage
For easy input of datasets, edit lines 41 and 43 accordingly after saving the dataset files to your Google Drive.  

# Questions?
If you have any further questions related to this repo, feel free to contact hamzaahmadafzal@gmail.com or raise an issue within this repo. I will do my best to reply as soon as possible.
