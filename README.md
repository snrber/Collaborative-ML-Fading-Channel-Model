# Collaborative-ML-Fading-Channel-Model
This repo contains the code for year 3 undergraduate project titled "Machine Learning for Receiver Design", Student: Afzal Hamza, Supervisor: Dr. Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, EEE Department, University of Surrey.

The idea of this project is to have a federation of wireless users to collect a distributed dataset upon which users train their respective local neural network (NN)s and then collaborate to train a universal wireless receiver.

For easy input of datasets, edit lines 41 and 43 accordingly after saving the dataset files to your Google Drive.
